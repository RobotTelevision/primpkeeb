I made this keyboard, you can make one too.

Here is the Tinkercad source so you can easily modify the design: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aghXsbsp0NS?sharecode=mO9z2KgYBp0ofla-hJ8e-j6PT9Jy5sDPr6z4HIgJ69o

If your not changing anything, stl's are in the STL folder.

Works with any MX sized switches. I used Kailh Choc switches and they fit fine.

optional rotory encoders used: https://a.co/d/5GsVWQX

Attached with M2 socket screws, because they look cool: https://a.co/d/dzBV0LV

to mount the pico you'll need standoff's like these: https://a.co/d/8AK0gV6 (i think i used the 3mm ones)

oh and you'll need some diodes: https://a.co/d/9ah8RBM

pick a layout, connect it together and solder up the keyboard matrix to the pico gpio.

Then bolt the whole thing to wood or polycarbonate or whatever.
