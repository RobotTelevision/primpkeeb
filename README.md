I made this keyboard, you can make one too.


Works with any MX sized switches. I used Kailh Choc switches and they fit fine.

optional rotory encoders used: https://a.co/d/5GsVWQX

Attached with M2 socket screws, because they look cool: https://a.co/d/dzBV0LV

to mount the pico you'll need standoff's like these: https://a.co/d/8AK0gV6 (i think i used the 3mm ones)

oh and you'll need some diodes: https://a.co/d/9ah8RBM
